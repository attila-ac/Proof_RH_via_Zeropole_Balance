Wondering around the Riemann zeta

Timeline and Notes:
- The manuscript was finalized and submitted to the **Annals of Mathematics** on **December 24, 2024**.
- On **December 25, 2024**, the LaTeX template was updated from the specific **aomart** format used for submission to the Annals of Mathematics to a more general template for broader accessibility. No substantive changes were made to the content of the manuscript.
- Formalization branch was added on the 2nd of January, 2025 with initial commits using coq proof assistant.
- On 4th of January an error was spotted related to how the trivial poles arise and the manuscript was updated and resubmitted with a fix. The primary fix pertains to the explicit introduction of trivial poles in the Hadamard product formulation and this oversight necessitated revisions to sections addressing the functional equation, Hadamard product, and related zeropole balance mechanics. While these changes refine the details of the framework. The core structure of the proof—built upon the zeropole balance framework—remains intact.
- Major update with extended divisor framework, 3 different compactification approaches, and addressing many smaller gaps in the proof attempt logic on 25th of January, 2025.
- Major update focusing on torus compactification only on 2th February 2025.
- Major update with finite periodic divisor structure on 3rd February 2025.
- Minor but important update related to Existence of Well-Defined Fundamental Domain Size 3 new subsections on 4th of February
- 2 relevant updates on 6th of February: i., Minimality, Uniqueness and Exclusion of Off-Critical Zeros section worked out rigorously especially the reductio ad absurdum structure, ii., Fundamental Domain Divisor Structure better established, got rid of fractional contribution, found simpler solution, closer to standard divisor theory
- major update on 12th of February with 3 new sections added in discussion, The Deep Structure of RH as Zeropole Balance, Imaginary Shadow Function and Imaginary Primes, RH as a Continuity Principle in Number Theory
- Important Update on the 12th of February: Somebody just reported a very serious issue with it, that might show the actual proof mechanic is flawed, am investigating but this seems like a pretty convincing blocke$
- 19th of February: new version of manuscript: Saddle Geometry and Complex Plane Eversion: A Topological Minimality Route to the Riemann Hypothesis$
- 20th of February Higher-Order Stability Analysis and Stage Independence Supp Material plus 2 manuscript updates
